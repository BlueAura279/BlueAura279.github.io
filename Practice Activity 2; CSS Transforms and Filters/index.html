            Hello, and welcome to my photography portfolio! Taking pictures is one of my favorite hobbies. I like to take pictures of environments and animals. <br>
            I am currently interested in expanding my protfolio with new subjects. With this in mind, I am currently offering photoshoots of anything and everything to expand my protfolio.<br>
            <br>
            I am avalible: Friday - Sunday from 2:00 PM till 8:00 PM <br>
            <br>
            I am currently only taking customers that are located in New Holland, PA. I do plan to branch out further (unless you would want to meet up in New Holland) in the future. <br>
            <br>
            Here are some of my photos featured on the right!
