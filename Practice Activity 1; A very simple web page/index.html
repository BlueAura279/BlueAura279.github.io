            Hello! My name is Jack and I am currently <em>selling a Wii console, games, and accessories</em> in order to pay off my tuition bill. <br> 
            Down the page I will talk about what all is up for sale!<br>
        </p>

        <h2><i>Nintendo</i> Wii Console</h2>

        <p>
            The Wii console has been a <b>huge</b> part of my childhood and was the jumpstarter to my passion and forever hobby of gaming.
            While it's not the latest gaming console or a high end device, it has brought so many memories for me, my family, and my friends.
            What's so special about the Wii is that you don't have to be a serious gamer to play the Wii, anyone can play this classic console that was very much loved in the past by millions of people worldwide.
            Even though <i>Nintendo</i> has discountinued the console and providing services, there is still a ever loving community that provide mods and enhancements to the Wii which always give new things to do and explore for the Wii.
            The Wii that I am selling is currently homebrewed, which means it mas been modified and altered then what is considered the official product.
        </p>

        <h2>Wii Games</h2>

        <p>
            While of course the console itself is amazing, it wouldn't be trully amazing without the games! In my prized collection, I have <strong>more than 20+</strong> games that are at your disposal to play! 
            There are plenty of Wii game classics that are hard to find now since of course they are not being made anymore.
            I'm sure for there to be a game that will suit your playstyle and for you to have fun with friends and family!
            <b>Some games I have for sale are:</b>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Mario Kart Wii</li>
            <li>New Super Mario Bros Wii</li>
            <li>Wii Sports</li>
            <li>Wii Sports Resort</li>
            <li>Wii Party</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Wii Controller and Accessories</h2>

        <p>
            The Wii remote is probably what makes the Wii so unique compared to other gaming devices.
            The Wii remote is basically a TV remote that has motion controls, where you can swing it like a tenis racket, or roll it like a bowling ball.
            You can also point at the TV with its included motion sensor to select and interact with your console.
            There are also accessories that can attach to the Wii remote that can further enhance its capabilites.
            For example, it can attach an accessory called a nunchuck that can make it feel like you are boxing but swining left with the nunchuck and right with the Wii remote.
            I also have an accessory that can turn it into a generic gaming contorller as well!
        </p>

        <p>
            Overall, I feel that anyone would love the Wii and it would be an amazing thing to have to play!<br>
