        <p class="movie_summary">
            As the Demon Slayer Corps train to prepare for what they feel is soon the ultimate battle, they get caught off guard 
            and suddenly get warped to the demons’ base, the Infinity Castle. They end up getting split up in this maze-like 
            castle that constantly has random doors open wherever they walk. Buildings also shift, which causes the castle to 
            never stay the same. Giyu Tomoioka & Tanjiro Kamado group up and fight the upper rank third demon Akaza. Tanjiro is 
            more prepared and ready for his rematch against Akaza after the demon killed a fellow hashira that Tanjiro worked with
             previously and really looked up to. Shinobu Kocho encounters Doma, an upper rank two demon that killed her older 
             sister Kanane and engages in a fight to gain revenge for her sister. Zenitsu Agatsuma encounters Kaigaku, who was a 
             fellow peer that trained with him previously before he turned into a demon and they engage in a battle to determine 
             who is stronger once and for all.
