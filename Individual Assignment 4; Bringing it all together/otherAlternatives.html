    <!-- Intro to gaming alternatives -->
    <p id="important_info" class="page_text">Maybe you are not ready for a PC yet, that is totally fine! There are plenty of other great options to choose from! Each device comes with its own special operating system (OS) and inputs that is built for the device. Here are some popular options:</p>

    <div class="customContainer">
    <!-- Performing layout with CSS Grid or Flexbox (Will use flexbox to change position of each gaming alternative via @media) -->

        <div>
            <h2>Xbox</h2>
            <!-- IMG & Info here -->
            <img id="console-Images" src="Xbox Consoles.png" alt="Xbox Consoles">
            <p class="">Xbox, a gaming company owned by Microsoft, is one of the major retailers for gaming consoles. Their current lineup is Xbox Series X & Xbox Series S. Xbox Series X is built to be a powerful console, while also including a disc drive. Xbox Series S is a smaller compact console that is made for digital video game titles, and built around Xbox’s Game Pass, a subscription that allows you to access many games published by Xbox.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2>PlayStation</h2>
            <!-- IMG & Info here -->
            <img id="console-Images" src="PlayStation Consoles.png" alt="PlayStation Consoles">
            <p class="">PlayStation, a gaming company owned by Sony, is another major retailer for gaming consoles. Their current lineup is the PlayStation 5, which is another great alternative for a powerful console. They also include a subscription that gives access to many games published by Sony. A disc reader is available, but their “Pro” version does not have this, but it allowed for more room to provide better specs in the console.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Nintendo</h2>
            <!-- IMG & Info here -->
            <img id="console-Images" src="Nintendo Consoles.png" alt="Nintendo Consoles">
            <p class="">Nintendo, another gaming company, is another major retailer for gaming consoles. Their current lineup of consoles is the Nintendo Switch. It is a handheld that comes with unique motion controllers but still has the default controller system. It is built to be a portable handheld device that you can take anywhere on the go. It also has exclusive video games made by Nintendo and are only available on the Nintendo Switch.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
            <!-- IMG & Info here -->
            <img id="console-Images" src="VR Consoles.png" alt="VR Consoles">
            <p class="">Virtual Reality (VR) is a unique way to game, with instead of using a TV or monitor, you wear a headset and get immersed in new ways to play. The headset also comes with unique controllers, one for each hand. Playing with VR is more active and gives more ways to play compared to consoles and PCs today. There are plenty of games that are built for VR that you cannot play on other platforms. The most popular VR headset currently is the Meta Quest 3/3s, created by Meta.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Upcoming Alternative: Steam PC</h2>
            <!-- IMG & Info here -->
            <img id="console-Images" src="Steam PC.png" alt="Steam PC">
            <p class="">While yes, the Steam PC is what it says it is and doesn't seem like a gaming PC alternative, it provides a custom operating system that works well with the major video game digital retailor Steam. It is to act like a console and a PC at the same time. While the company Valve has not released the Steam PC yet, it is expected to release early next year (2026). It is also expected to have high-end specifications while also being budget friendly.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Personal Favorite: Steam Deck</h2>
            <!-- IMG & Info here -->
            <img id="console-Images" src="Steam Deck.jpg" alt="Steam Deck">
            <p class="">Another gaming alternative made by Valve, and my personal favorite alternative is Steam Deck. The Steam Deck acts like a handheld console while also having the capability to function as a mini-PC (It is mostly used as a handheld, but it has that option!). It has its own operating system, which is what the Steam PC is going to be based off. This is my personal favorite since I buy all my games through steam, and having a device that I can take with me on the go has been a nice pleasure of mine.</p>
