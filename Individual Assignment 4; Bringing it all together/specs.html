    <h2>Understanding the parts inside a Gaming PC</h2>
    <!-- [Will include] Lists (ordered or unordered) -->
    <!-- Writing goes here -->
    <p id="important_info" class="page_text">
        Now to truly understand a gaming PC, you need to know all the parts that are in the system. Here I will list all the parts in a gaming PC and what each specifically does.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li id="important_info">Processors:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>CPU: Also known as “Central Processing Unit,” is the main processor that all other components in a PC serve. The best way to describe this is that the CPU does math/processes that are given by applications/software.</li>
            <li>Video Card/ Graphics Card/ GPU: Also known as “Graphics Processing Unit,” is the alternative processor that is made to process 3-D graphics and lighting. So, if you were playing a video game like Minecraft, Fortnite, Battlefield 6, and such, the GPU would be working to give you visuals.</li>
        </ol>
        <li id="important_info">Data Storage:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>RAM: Also known as “Random Access Memory,” is fast storage, meant to assist the Processors with calculating and giving information. It needs to be fast and for the PC to run things quickly and efficiently. It also has plenty of storage to process more things at once.</li>
            <li>SSD/HDD: Since RAM is only usable when the device is on, we need to have a place to store all information while the device is off/ for a longer period. That’s where SSD/HDD come in. It is slower than RAM but is built to keep and has a lot more storage than RAM.</li>
        </ol>
        <li id="important_info">Other Important Parts:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>PSU, also known as “Power Supply Unit,” is where all the power for a PC comes from. It acts like power manager, giving necessary power to all parts of the PC.</li>
            <li>The motherboard is another important part of a PC, since it acts like the backbone, connecting all the parts to each other to work together.</li>
            <li>Fans/Cooler help the PC not to overheat, since all that power produces heat, and overheating parts are not healthy for a PC.</li>
            <li>A case helps protect all the parts inside of a PC (which is all parts listed above) as well as helping produce airflow which is another way to help cool down the PC components.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h2>Two options of obtaining a Gaming PC: Pre-built or Building one yourself?</h2>
    <!-- Writing goes here -->
     <p class="page_text">Choosing to build your own gaming PC or a pre-built is up to preference. I personally would suggest a pre-built since it is cheaper and easier to get a pre-built gaming PC. Also pre-built comes with warranties in case something happens during use. If you would like to customize a gaming PC but also have it pre-built for you, go to IBUYPOWER to fully customize a gaming PC with parts they provide.</p>
