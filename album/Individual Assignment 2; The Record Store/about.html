        <p id="info">We at DaTunes wanted to keep tradition with owning music and albums physically, in any form! We sell official music/albums from movies, video games, series, and popular artists. We also love to help those that want to get into the music business to assist in putting their music on well designed vinyl, cassette tapes, and so much more! We want to keep the nostalgia of using unique ways of playing music compared to digital means. We find music enjoyable, we hope we can make it the same for you.</p>
